  Your challenge is to build out this bmi calculator and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  This project mainly focuses on HTML, CSS & Javascript. You will need to know some sought of javascript to complete the functionality of the calculator.
  The use of HTML & CSS is to design the webpage and body of the calculator. There is a picture of final design in the starter files for your reference.
  Your users should be able to:
  - View the calculator properly irrespective of their screen size. 
  - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.
  The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.html` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
  Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
