## This is the main step.

## Add functionality to the calculator using javascript.

## Define the variables and properties as required by following the steps

## Add the bmi formula using javascript.

## First and foremost, we will accept the userâ€™s weight and height, and then we will add that value to the formula. Whatever the value is, we will compare it using the for loop, and then define the person as underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese based on that value.

# Congratulations, the project is completed
