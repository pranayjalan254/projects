A healthy and normal BMI should be between 18.5 and 25. It is underweight if its value is less than 18, which is unhealthy. It is considered fat or overweight if its value exceeds 25.

There are some criteria that will help you determine which class you belong in, such as underweight, healthy, overweight, and obese.
