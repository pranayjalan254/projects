A healthy and normal BMI should be between 18.5 and 25. It is underweight if its value is less than 18, which is unhealthy. It is considered fat or overweight if its value exceeds 25.

There are some criteria that will help you determine which class you belong in, such as underweight, healthy, overweight, and obese. 

Extract the starter files from spec.yml file and see the final design. Try to imitate it as close as possible.
In further steps I have broke down the whole project which will make it easy for you to make it.
