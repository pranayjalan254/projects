## Adding The Buttons

In this step you need to add the buttons for your body-mass index calculator.
Make sure you style it properly by referring to the final design in the starter files of this project.
Also make sure to align them and give the color grading as given.
You can also use the CSS button generators from the internet for custom design but I prefer you to make it by yourself.
